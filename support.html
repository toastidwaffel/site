									<summary>What accessories do you recommend?</summary>
									<div style="margin-left:10%;">
										<b>Headstrap</b><br>
										We recommend upgrading the head strap for guest comfort, sanitation, and convenience.<br><br>
										We like the <a href="https://www.kiwidesign.com/products/k4-comfort-head-strap">KiwiDesign Comfort Strap</a>. It's cheap, easy-to-use, and comfortable. They also make a <a href="https://www.kiwidesign.com/products/battery-head-strap-for-quest-3?srsltid=AfmBOortO_RPNwcV4bzKQaa7lwntWqKtPIxXeEatcdS6kgptScO824DD">battery strap</a> that will extend the battery another ~50%.<br><br>
										If you're expecting non-stop all-day traffic, you might try the <a href="https://www.bobovr.com/products/e3-pro">BoboVR Hot-Swappable Battery Strap</a>, though we have not tried this one. <br><br>
										<b>Facial Interface</b><br>
										We strongly advise upgrading the facial interface to make it more comfortable and easy to wipe clean. <br><br>
										There are many suitable options, but we like the <a href="https://www.kiwidesign.com/products/v3-face-cushion-pad">KiwiDesign Facial Interface</a>, for its comfort and ventilation (to address fogging).

									<summary>Can I play this outside?</summary>
									<div style="margin-left:10%;">
										We don't recommend it. If you do, take precautions:
										<ul>
										<li>If the sun shines through the lenses onto the screen, it will burn marks into the screen.</li>
										<li>While in the game, you're blindfolded from the real world. Make sure to have someone not in the game keeping an eye out for any potential hazards.</li>

								<h2>Common Issues</h2>
								<details>
									<summary>The Game Became Unaligned</summary>
									<div style="margin-left:10%;">
									You can press the in-game menu button and select <b><i>Re-Calibrate</i></b>. You will be prompted to touch the 2 calibration points again.<br>
									If it continues to happen, it may be due to one of the following reasons.
										<details>
											<summary>The Screen May Have Turned Off.</summary>
											<div style="margin-left:10%;">
											Ensure the headset fits your head properly. You may be bumping the power button or trigering the presence sensor while adjusting the headset mid-game.
											<br><br>You might consider taping a small piece of paper over the presence sensor. <i>(Note: Only the Quest 2 and 3 have a presence sensor, the 3S does not.)</i>
											</div>
										</details>
										<details>
											<summary>Dirty external cameras can lead to poor tracking.</summary>
											<div style="margin-left:10%;">
											Clean them carefully with a microfiber cloth before each session.
											</div>
										</details>
										<details>
											<summary>You may be experiencing an OS-wide tracking issue.</summary>
											<div style="margin-left:10%;">
											If you have too many guardians mapped, the headset can sometimes start jumping back and forth between two in-game positions. <br><br>
											Clear your guardian history in settings and restart the headset to fix this.
											</div>
										</details>
										<details>
											<summary>Have you moved the calibration points?</summary>
											<div style="margin-left:10%;">
											Any slight difference from their original position could mess things up. You may need to delete and re-create the playspace.
											</div>
										</details>
										<details>
											<summary>The Quest 2 Can't Always Disable Recentering.</summary>
											<div style="margin-left:10%;">
											Even though we have re-centering disabled in shared-space mode, sometimes the Quest 2 still allows players to recenter. We found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trobing-Blocker-Computer-MacBook-Protector/dp/B07RV6ZQL4/ref=sr_1_1">these webcam covers </a> fit nicely over the Quest button (hold to recenter) and did the trick.
											</div>
										</details>
									</div>
								</details>
								<details>
									<summary>I can't make the boundary big enough to play.</summary>
									<div style="margin-left:10%;">
										The Meta Guardian Boundary maxes out at 10m x 10m. We have a few 10m x 10m arenas you can play by setting up overlapping Guardians, but to play the larger arenas in shared space, you will need to disable the Meta Guardian Boundary. To do this, you have 2 options:
										<details>
											<summary>Manual Guardian Toggle</summary>
											<div style="margin-left:10%;">
												If you put your headset in Developer Mode (which anyone can do following <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/">these instructions from the Meta Website</a>) you will have a new option in the settings to disable Physical Space Features.<br>
												This is the only way to play the largest maps, but since <b  style="color: red;">this removes some of the safeguards Meta has in-place, it carries some risk</b>, which you bear the responsibility for.<br>
												If you do not re-enable Physical Space Features when you're done, <b  style="color: red;">you will not have a guardian (or any warning that you're missing one)</b> in other games that depend on them.

											</div>
										</details>
										<details>
									<summary>Auto-Disable Boundary</summary>
									<div style="margin-left:10%;">
										We made a version of the game that will automatically turn off the boundary for you in-game so you will not have to remember to turn it back on for other games. 
										<ul><li>If you are playing in spaces larger than 24m x 14m (only needed for our 3 biggest Arenas), you will start to see pop-ups saying you've "Moved Too Far". In our testing, these pop-ups do not appear to mess with alignment, so you can either ignore these, or once-again disable Physical Space Features, <b  style="color: red;">which you will again need to remember to enable for other games</b>.<br></li>
										<li>Since the boundary is completely disabled in this version, we have disabled Stationary/Roomscale Mode for safety.</li>
										</ul>
										Unfortunately Meta restricts which developers are able to publish boundaryless apps to the store, so we are not yet allowed to publish this version via traditional methods.<br>
										To use this version, you can switch to the RC Channel after you purchase the game:
										<ol>
											<li>Open the Quest app menu, click the menu button on the Catastrophic Inversion card.</li>
											<li>Select Settings</li>
											<li>Click Release Channels</li>
											<li>Select RC</li>
											<li>Wait for the RC version of the game to install.</li>
											<li>You will now be on this version of the game until you switch back to the Live channel.</li>
										</ol>

									<summary>I keep getting a message saying I've moved too far</summary>
									<div style="margin-left:10%;">
										You are likely playing in the Boundaryless edition of the game. Unfortunately Meta can't simply let it be boundaryless. This is a system-level warning and we can't turn it off for you.<br><br>
										In our testing, these pop-ups do not appear to mess with alignment, so you can ignore these, only play in spaces smaller than 24m x 14m, or disable Physical Space Features (see above), <b  style="color: red;">which you will again need to remember to enable for other games</b>.

									<summary>Motion Sickness</summary>
									<div style="margin-left:10%;">
										<b>Full-Scale Mode</b> in a gym is very agreeable, even to those who are highly prone to motion sickness. It feels natural to play beause there is no joystick locomotion. All movement is the way you would actually move.<br><br>
										If you are prone to motion sickness, avoid stairs and building edges, as well as joystick motion if playing at home in <b>Stationary Mode</b>
									</div>
								</details>
								<details>
									<summary>Single Hand Operation</summary>
									<div style="margin-left:10%;">
										Everything in the game can be operated with one hand (either one).
									</div>
								</details>
								<details>
									<summary>Height & Mobility</summary>
									<div style="margin-left:10%;">
									<ul>
										<li>Buttons in-game are all either 1 meter high or adjust to the height of the player. Most can be shot to activate.</li>
										<li>One game action requires reaching behind your head.</li>
										<li>Depending on the height of the player, weapons dropped by defeated players can sometimes drop high enough that it's hard to reach them.</li>
									</ul>
									</div>
								</details>
								<details>
									<summary>Color Blindness</summary>
									<div style="margin-left:10%;">
										We have not yet eliminated all dependence on color, but tried to focus on heavy contrast, avoiding common color-blindness patterns.
										<ul>
										<li>Interactable elements are white, while the rest of the game is single colors and dark greys.</li>
										<li>Team colors are Red and Blue.</li>
									</ul>
